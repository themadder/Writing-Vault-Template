# SET TEMPLATER TO USE SPECIFIC TEMPLATES IN EACH FOLDER
First enable 'Trigger Templater on new file creation', then scroll down to Folder Templates.
Enable Folder Templates, and connect the folders to their templates.
There are some extra templates within the Obsidian.MD vault I've provided here if you want to add new folders for them or prefer them over the existing template you can use them or delete them, all up to user.
