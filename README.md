# Writing-Vault-Template
This is an Obsidian.MD Template Vault, meant to be copied and set up by the user with Obsidian.MD.  
You should probably have Obsidian.MD if you're reading this.  
All notes with "Placeholder" or "Placehold" can be deleted or replaced with proper template to start off your project, they are mostly just to hold the structure in place.

# Reccomended Setup
## Fantasy Statblocks
Technically, none of my templates rely on this plugin, but it's super neat if you're into ttrpg!!
## Set TEMPLATER to use correct templates in each folder
First enable 'Trigger Templater on new file creation', then scroll down to Folder Templates.
Enable Folder Templates, and connect the folders to their templates.
There are some extra templates within the Obsidian.MD vault I've provided here if you want to add new folders for them or prefer them over the existing template you can use them or delete them, all up to User.
## Relationships & Calendars, & Manuscripts
I did not include a calander plugin as that's up to User, and maybe per Use, on if they prefer the simple Calendar Plugin, or perhaps Calendarium for a Fantasy Calendar.
For relationships I prefer to use the Canvas feature, or you can use other similar plugins.
The Manuscripts folder has no templates associated with it as this is the space I reserve for the Longform project folders.
## Arcs
This is an idea I had to track changes made to notes over time without having to rely on revisions, which is just copying a version into a separate folder and renaming it.  
1. Make a folder for what you've decided to Arc.
2. Copy notes into folder, Rename them with numbers so they appear in chronological order
	1. Renaming Idea: Type-Name.  eg, Location-Mackinac Island, Character-Shaggy Rogers.
3. I would personally link them to the associated turning point via properties or use a tag if it were for several different things that got "arced" all together.
## Forward all Photos & Attachments to the /attchs Folder, Hide Template Notes from Graph View
This is simply for those who don't know how, but in your _Files and links_ settings you can set the **Default location for new attachments** and this is where you would set the /attchs folder as your attachments folder.
Under this setting you can also Exclude z.Junk/temps/ so your graph might be a little neater, if you're into that kinda thing.
## Read the plugin READMEs
For all the community plugins that you want to take the time to set up (ie, Leaflet for maps) take the time to read the READMEs as that will offer you more support than I can here.
